        Welcome to our E-bike rental company based in SRM! We are a group of
        ambitious second-year students who are passionate about sustainability
        and eco-friendly transportation. <br />
        Our mission is to provide a convenient and affordable way for people to

        E-bikes are the future of transportation, and we want to be at the
        forefront of this movement. <br />
        We started this company as a project in our Software Engineering class,
        but it quickly grew into something much bigger. <br />

        sets. Some of us have experience in marketing, while others have a
        background in engineering. However, we all share a common goal: to make
        our city a cleaner and more sustainable place to live. <br />
        At our E-bike rental company, we offer a variety of rental options to
        suit your needs. Whether you're looking for a quick ride around town or
        a full-day adventure, we have a rental package that's right for you. Our
        bikes are well-maintained and equipped with the latest safety features,
        so you can ride with confidence. <br />
        We are committed to providing exceptional customer service and ensuring
        that every rental experience is a positive one. If you have any
        questions or concerns, our team is always here to help. <br />
